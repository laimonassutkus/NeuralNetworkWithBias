Some simple neural networks

Currently includes:
1) Suns spots predictions - written in MATLAB. Predict sun spots in the upcoming year.
2) Simple back-propagation neural network - written in C++. Has compiled DLLs and Libs, a testing environment and a network itself.
3) Above or below project which makes network to learn about some given function while generating random points.
